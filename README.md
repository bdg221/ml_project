About this data
This is a legacy resource. Data in this format has been circulated by various people for many years, and there are many applications and users who have tools which take data in this format. It is maintained by Chadwick Baseball Bureau to support compatibility with those tools and programs. As such, the schema is not open to amendments, either in terms of the scope of coverage or in terms of the data categories available.
This is a free resource. Statistical data will be updated once at some point during the MLB offseason. To borrow the slogan used by ProMods, "It's ready when it's ready." New releases will be announced via our Twitter account at @chadwickbureau. We, politely, will not be able to respond to any enquiries as to when new versions of the data will be released.
These data are maintained wholly by Chadwick Baseball Bureau, for the benefit of the community. Users who require data of a different scope, in a different format, and/or with more specific schedules for updates are encouraged to enquire about our various licensing options.
